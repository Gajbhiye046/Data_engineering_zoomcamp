Question 1: Knowing docker tags

winpty docker run -it python3.9 bash

Question 3: Count records

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM green_taxi_trips
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day',lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-01-15'

Question 4 : Largest trip for each day

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',lpep_pickup_datetime),MAX(trip_distance) 
FROM green_taxi_trips
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

Question 5 : The number of passengers

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM green_taxi_trips
WHERE passenger_count = 2 AND DATE_TRUNC('day',lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-01-01'

Question 6 : largest tip

With loco_table as 
	(SELECT "LocationID" id,
	 "Zone" as region 
	 FROM zones)
	
select gt."DOLocationID" ,loco_table.region, MAX(gt.tip_amount)
FROM green_taxi_trips gt 
JOIN loco_table
ON loco_table.id = gt."DOLocationID"
WHERE "PULocationID" IN (SELECT "LocationID" 
						 FROM zones 
						 WHERE "Zone" LIKE '%Astoria%')
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
